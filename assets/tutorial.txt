@1@
>This is you. You are an ULTRANAUT.
>Use D and A to walk side to side.
>Use SPACE to jump.

@2@
>You packed a map. Whew!
>Press 'X' to bring your Map up.

@3@
>Great. That little cyan dot is you!
>You are currently on a planet.
>Use PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN to zoom in and out.

@4@
>There is a greenish dot on the planet, just
>over your horizon. Go and check it out!

@5@
>This is the Odyssey Lander you probably 
>used to get here.
>Get close to it and press 'U' to get in.

@6@
>Sweet ride. Notice your various meters.
>FUEL is what it sounds like - it allows you
>to fire your engines and travel the cosmos.
>MONO is monopropellant - it's like the ship's
>jet pack. The big engines can't fire in all 4 
>directions, and the monopropellant comes into
>play when docking and fine tuning movements.
>
>Press 'W' to fire your engines and 'A' and 'D'
>to change your ship's rotation.

@7@
>There was something else on the map, too...
>Press 'X' to open it again. Zoom out and
>hover your mouse over the little red marker.

@8@
>Aha! 
>It's your interplanetary drive 
>that's orbiting the planet! 
>That's how you got here. Let's dock with it!

@9@
>But first, some basic orbital mechanics.
>Orbiting is essentially going too fast sideways to hit a
>planet's surface. You get pulled towards it, but you
>don't hit it if you're going too fast to!
>Make sure your Odyssey is facing upwards, fire your
>engines for 3 seconds by pressing 'W'.
>While firing, tap the 'D' key to begin what's called a 
>'Gravity Turn'.

@10@
>Nice. Stop firing and open your map.

@11@
>Now, it says that you're on a suborbital trajectory 
>(i.e., you're not quite in an orbital one yet.)
>Your current path is the green one.
>That "A" stands for Apogee - the highest point in your 
>trajectory.
>In the bottom right corner, there is a little gray box. 
>Click it.

@12@
>This is your Navigational Ball. 
>It shows where you're going.
>When the blue arrow (your ship) is facing the Plus, 
>you are facing in the direction you are currently heading in. 
>This is called the Prograde Direction.
>Similarly, the Minus represents Retrograde, the exact opposite
>to your direction of motion.
>Turn to face Prograde (the Plus on the NavBall) and fire your engines
>until your trajectory does not touch the planet at all.

@13@
>Hooray! You are in orbit!
>Pretty simple, huh?
>When you face the Prograde marker and burn, the height of your
>orbit increases everywhere apart from where you burn.
>Similarly, when you face the Retrograde marker and burn, 
>the height of your orbit decreases everywhere apart 
>from where you burn.

@14@
>Why not practice orbiting and deorbiting a few times, and 
>press F2 when you're ready to begin docking.
>Make sure to click the Interplanetary Drive in the Map View
>to set it as your target!

@15@
>Cue the Interstellar Music. We're attempting docking!
>Go back to the planet's surface. We'll wait until out
>target passes above us in the sky before we start moving,
>otherwise things get *really* complicated.

@16@
>When the ship is just about to pass over your position, 
>burn upwards and towards the target (this direction is
>visible as the pink dot on the pink ball on your 
targeting computer. When the blue arrow faces the dot, 
you're heading towards the target.)
>When you're pretty close, turn to face your 
>Target Retrograde, indicated by the yellow dot
>on the same pink circle.

@17@
>We'll get back to you when your distance is less than
>100m and your relative velocity is less than 10m/s.
>Remember, you have multidirectional RCS! No need
>for big engine burns!

@18@
>Awesome! Final approach!
>Point towards your ship and fire your RCS so you
>start travelling towards it. When you're EXTREMELY
>close (like 20m), we'll come back and help you.

@19@
>Alright.
>At the bottom of the Interplanetary Ship there
>is a docking port. Get the top of your
>ship to go in that port and you'll be docked.
>Good luck!

@20@
>Success!
>You did what only the most experienced spacecraft 
>pilots could do! 
>Now you may travel to other planets if you wish.

@21@
>However, when you get there, don't try land
>the Interplanetary Drive!! It doesn't have legs!!!
>
>When you need to, hold 'F1' to undock the lander.
>You may refuel the lander on other planets
>if they have sufficient Hydrocarbon contents in
>their surface. You have to land first!

@22@
>The Interplanetary Drive doesn't need refueling,
>it uses electric propulsion. 
>
>Solar panels, baby!

@23@
>That is all from Ultranaut v0.0.1!
>Features to look out for in the future:
>
>*Vastly improved graphics!
>*Space stations! (cooool!)
>*Music and noises!
>*A story!
>*Perhaps even multiplayer!
>*Resource Mining!
>*Space Craft Synthesis!
>*Death!
